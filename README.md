Describe the use case you have chosen.
We have chosen to work with the structural use case where we focus on the calculation of structural elements. We find the total length of the beams in the project and estimate a total price. 

Who is the use case for?
The use case is for customers that want an estimated price of the structural elements in their project.

What disciplinary (non BIM) expertise did you use to solve the use case?
We used websites of construction markets to find a suitable price of beams which we used for the calculations.   

What IFC concepts did you use in your script (or would you use in the rest of the tool)?
We selected the beams in the IFC file and extracted information of the beams in order to create a script.  

What disciplinary analysis does it require?
External experts evaluate the calcualtions.

What building elements are you interested in?
We’re interested in beams. 

What (use cases) need to be done before you can start your use case?
We need to have a IFC file which consists of project materials and corresponding information.

What is the input data for your use case?
We don’t have input data. We only have the IFC file as input. 

What other use cases are waiting for your use case to complete?
To buy structural elements for the project.
