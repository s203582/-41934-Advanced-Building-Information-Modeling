## Our learning experience:
### Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended:
Our level at the beginning of the course was Modeller, and after the course we ended up being a Self Learner.

### What else do you still need to learn:
More comands in blender, and all the differet things blender can be used for to analyse the IFC-files and get more comfotable and experienced with OpenBIM.

### How you might use OpenBIM in the future:
We properbly wont use OpenBIM much in the future, but it is nice to know the basics of OpenBIM if we were to work on a bigger project in the future using BIM.

## Our process of developing the tutorial:
### Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
Yes, we have gained a lot of information about BIM, which helps deciding if we want to work with it in the future.

### Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
It is nice to be able to freely choose a use case because we have different backgrounds as students. But it would be nice to get some feedback duing the course, to confirm that the use case is valid.

### Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?
There were a lot of tools, but it was hard to know what to use, as we wasn't introduced to all the tools (Because of Tims illness). It would be easier to use the different tools if we had been giving more lectures, which would have given a better understanding of the concepts.

## Our recived feedback on the tutorial:
We have recived this feedback from group 42:

### Code:
The code looks very good and well made. It was easy to read and it worked smoothly. It is a solid tool to use in the workplace. It is nice that you have calculated the price for the different type of beams so that it is more accurate to use, and gives a more precise anticipation of the total price for the structural elements. We also liked how it makes a new IFC file so that its easy to use while working on the project and its easy, but valuable to use.

### Markdown:
Your markdown file explained in a easy and structured way how you have answered the assignment and how your tool is working. In the github its also easy to navigate and find what you are looking for.

### The video:
You interpreted the video-project in another way than us, but we found it very helpful. It explained the code very well, as the script explained the code in a good way at the same time.  
It is clearly at a learning level 2, as the coding was a bit more complex, but at the same time, achievable with the walkthrough.

## Our future for Advanced use of OpenBIM:
### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
Properbly not, since we have learned that OpenBIM isn't for us.

### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
Maybe, depending on our future career and the path we choose.

## Wrap up:
We have learned how GitHub works. We didn't know anything about OpenBIM at the start of the course, which meant that we could only get better. It was very complicated to use the different tools at the start of the course, but it ended up getting easier. The assignments have helped us get better at OpenBIM, which our assingments refelcts, as they got more advanced throughout the course, and we were able to execute our ambitions to Blender through learning Python.
